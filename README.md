# Code-Challenge-1

This project contains solutions to three JavaScript-based coding challenges for Week 1. Each challenge is implemented in its own dedicated folder.

The challenges are:

1. Chai Bora Ingredient Calculator 
   Calculates the required ingredients (water, milk, tea leaves, sugar) for making a specific number of cups of Kenyan chai.

2. Boda Boda Ride Fare Estimator 
   Estimates the total fare for a boda boda ride based on distance and standard rates.

3. Mobile Money Transaction Fee Estimator
   Computes the mobile money transaction fee using a 1.5% rule, with min and max fee limits.

Each challenge prompts the user for input, performs calculations, and displays user-friendly output in the console.
